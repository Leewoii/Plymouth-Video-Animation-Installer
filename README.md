# Plymouth-Video-Animation-Installer
A safe, automated installer that converts a video (.mp4) into an animated Plymouth boot splash and installs it as the system default.  This project is designed for Ubuntu / Xubuntu (22.04+), including Cubic-based custom ISOs, and supports both interactive and non-interactive usage.
